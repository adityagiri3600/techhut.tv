Upgrading or pulling back the kernel on Arch is a common headache—especially when the latest release drops a bug or the hardware suddenly misbehaves. In this quick guide we’ll walk through the safest ways to **upgrade** or **downgrade** any package, with a focus on the kernel, and show how tools like *yay* and *downgrade* make the process painless.

## The Kernel: A First-Class Citizen

The Linux kernel is just another package in your system. Whether it’s `linux-6.14` from *core* or `linux-6.13` from *testing*, you can swap it the same way you install any other package. The only nuance is that a kernel change requires a reboot, and you must keep matching headers and modules in sync.

```bash
# List all installed kernel packages
pacman -Q | grep linux

# Upgrade to the newest available
sudo pacman -Syu

# Switch to a specific version (e.g. 6.13)
sudo pacman -S linux-6.13 linux-headers-6.13
```

If you’re using a derivative like EndeavourOS, the kernel lives in a dedicated package, but the commands stay the same.

## Why You Might Downgrade

Sometimes the bleeding-edge kernel brings regressions: driver glitches, security misbehaviour, or simply a new kernel that hasn’t been tested with your GPU or CPU. Before you hand over the reins, consider:

- **Bug tracking**: Check the Arch bug tracker for your kernel version. If the bug is already filed, you might simply need to wait for a fix.
- **Dependencies**: Downgrading a package can require pulling back any libraries that depend on its newer ABI.
- **Reboot and re-load**: Kernel changes are only applied after a reboot. Any services that load kernel modules (e.g., NVIDIA, VirtualBox) will need restarting.

## The *downgrade* Tool

The simplest way to pull back a package is the *downgrade* helper. It’s a tiny Bash script that pulls the old package from Pacman's cache or the Arch Linux Archive (ALA) and installs it.

```bash
# Install the helper if you don’t already have it
yay -S downgrade

# Downgrade the kernel (will prompt for the version)
sudo downgrade linux

# After you pick the version, the tool will handle dependencies
```

It’s interactive and safe: it will refuse to downgrade if the selected version would break your system. It also offers a handy `--skip` flag to keep packages from being upgraded later by adding them to `IgnorePkg` in `/etc/pacman.conf`.

## Fallback: Pacman Cache

If the *downgrade* tool can’t find a version (maybe because the cache was cleaned), you can still roll back manually:

```bash
# Find the package file in the cache
ls /var/cache/pacman/pkg/ | grep linux-6.13

# Install the older package
sudo pacman -U /var/cache/pacman/pkg/linux-6.13-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
```

Pacman will resolve any dependency changes for you, but if a library has a soname change you may need to rebuild dependent packages.

## Arch Linux Archive (ALA)

For older kernel releases that never appeared in your cache, the ALA is a lifesaver. It’s a daily snapshot of the official repos. Browse the web interface, download the tarball, and install it as above:

```bash
wget https://archive.archlinux.org/packages/l/linux/linux-6.13-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
sudo pacman -U linux-6.13-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
```

After you’re back on a stable kernel, add it to `IgnorePkg` to avoid accidental upgrades.

## Managing Everything with *yay*

*yay* is more than a package installer; it’s an AUR helper that understands both official and community packages. Use it to search, install, upgrade, and *downgrade*:

```bash
# Search for a package (official + AUR)
yay firefox

# Install a specific AUR package
yay -S google-chrome

# Upgrade everything (including AUR)
yay -Syu

# Downgrade a package with the built-in helper
yay -S downgrade
sudo downgrade nginx
```

*yay* also offers cache cleaning (`yay -Sc`) and orphan removal (`yay -Yc`), so you keep your system lean.

## Quick Summary

- **Upgrade** with `pacman -Syu` or `yay -Syu`.
- **Downgrade** with the *downgrade* helper (`sudo downgrade <pkg>`).
- **Fallback** to the Pacman cache (`pacman -U /var/cache/pacman/pkg/...`).
- **Old releases** via Arch Linux Archive.
- **Keep it tidy** with *yay*’s cleanup utilities.

If you ever hit a kernel that makes your screen flicker or your GPU refuse to load, remember: the package manager is your friend, not the enemy. Grab a coffee, run the commands, reboot, and you’re back in the swing room. Happy hacking!
